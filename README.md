# github.com/DanBoardman/discrete_tests/

Open sandbox for developing and validating statistical inference testing functions for discrete distributions.

Inspiration: Shameless MATLAB Port of Krishnamoorthy's "Two Poisson Means" fortran code. https://github.com/leiferlab/testPoisson

Original inspiration:  5. Two Poisson Means, 6. Power: Two Poisson Means from http://www.ucs.louisiana.edu/~kxk4695/StatCalc.htm

Theory: Krishnamoorthy, K and Thomson, J. (2004) A more powerful test for comparing two Poisson means. Journal of Statistical Planning and Inference, 119, 249-267

4 DEC 2018: Uploaded barely working version of Krishnamoorthy and Thomson's E-test.
Needs: Where do I start? Testing. Perhaps warning suppression.
