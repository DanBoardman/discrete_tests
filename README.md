# discrete_tests
Sandbox for developing and validating statistical inference testing functions for discrete distributions.

Project description
Motivation: You're looking at foot traffic counts from two available storefronts. One is higher, but the samples were taken over just one week and you're not sure how confident to be in the apparent difference. The storefront that more people passed also costs more to rent and if you're wrong it could make it harder to be profitable and cost your job at the company. If only you knew the odds!
